You will also need access to a NOMAD Oasis instance or a local NOMAD installation. Step 1: Create the plugins.txt File \u00b6 In the docker directory, create a file named plugins.txt with the following content: git+https://github.com/QYB-Quantum-Yield-Berlin-GmbH/nomad-luqy-plugin.git@main This file specifies the source from which the plugin will be installed. Step 2: Create the Dockerfile.plugins \u00b6 In the docker directory, create a file named Dockerfile.plugins with the following content: FROM ghcr.io/fairmat-nfdi/nomad-distro-template:main USER root RUN (command -v apk >/dev/null 2>&1 && apk add --no-cache git) || \\ (apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) COPY plugins.txt /tmp/plugins.txt ENV PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1 PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1 RUN /opt/venv/bin/python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade || true && \\ /opt/venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && \\ /opt/venv/bin/python3 -m pip install -r /tmp/plugins.txt USER 1000:1000 This file defines the Docker image for the plugin, installs Git, and sets up the required Python packages. Step 3: Build the Docker Image \u00b6 Navigate to the docker directory in your terminal and run the following command to build the Docker image: docker build -t my-nomad-oasis:with-luqy -f Dockerfile.plugins . This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile.plugins you created. Step 4: Update the docker-compose.yaml File \u00b6 In the deployment directory, open the docker-compose.yaml file and ensure it includes the following services configuration: version : '3.8' services : app : image : my-nomad-oasis:with-luqy # Additional configuration for the app service worker : image : my-nomad-oasis:with-luqy # Additional configuration for the worker service north : image : my-nomad-oasis:with-luqy # Additional configuration for the north service This configuration specifies that the app, worker, and north services will use the custom image you built. Step 5: Start the Services \u00b6 Finally, navigate to the deployment directory and run the following command to start the services: docker-compose up This command will start the NOMAD services with the LuQY Pro plugin installed.
